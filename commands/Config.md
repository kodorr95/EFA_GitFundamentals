# git config

When first setting up git, you'll need to work with the git config commands in order to setup your identity.

Your identity can be setup with the commands:

```
git config --global user.name "InsertYourName"

git config --global user.email "InsertYourEmail"
```

For more information, view the [first time git setup](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Setup) documentation
